# Manager README

Hi, I'm Adam, and if you're reading this you might be reporting to me. For our 1 to 1's I plan on meeting with you at least weekly, but you should please feel free to reach out with any questions in-between those meetings.

Because I live in Brussels, I split my day in 3 chunks to create as much crossover as possible while also maintaining some family time structure in my evenings. Those chunks are roughly:

* 9:30am-11:30am CET (super early EST and rediculously early PST)
* 2:30pm-5:30pm CET (8:30am-11:30am EST and 5:30-8:30am PST)
* 8pm-11pm CET (2pm-5pm EST and 11am-2pm PST)

I’ll try not to ping you after-hours (in your respective tie zones), but you should feel free to message me whenever is convenient to you and I’ll respond as soon as I’m able (which will probably be the following morning, if it is after hours for me). If something cannot wait that long, please feel free to call or text me at +32 487 721 701.

&mdash; Adam
